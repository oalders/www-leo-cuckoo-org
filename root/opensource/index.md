## Perl Modules

### Text::vCard
	
Text::vCard is used to parse a vCard
	formatted file into a perl object with accessor methods.
	It can be downloaded from <a
	href="https://metacpan.org/release//Text-vCard/">https://metacpan.org/release//Text-vCard/</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/llap/source/browse">Subversion</a>


### Data::Pageset
	
This perl object inherits from Data::Page and adds additional functionality
	so that one can create page sets rather than having one massive list
	of pages. Latest version can be downloaded from <a href="https://metacpan.org/release//Data-Pageset/">https://metacpan.org/release//Data-Pageset/</a>, <a
	href="http://code.google.com/p/llap/source/browse">Subversion</a>
	
### SVG::TT::Graph
	
This perl module makes creating presentation quality SVG graphs
from any data source very easy, with many display options;
key, title, sub title, x-lables, y-lables etc. 
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release//SVG-TT-Graph/">https://metacpan.org/release//SVG-TT-Graph/</a>, <a href="/projects/SVG-TT-Graph/">Examples</a>


### Apache::AuthCookieNTLM
	
This module created by my self and Fancoise Dehinbo
uses Apache::AuthenNTLM as a base class so that you can
use the fact that IE will send the users Windows login
details (if the server is trusted and the option is
turned on) and authenticate the user against the Windows
Network PDC. This is mostly useful for intranets
so that users don't have to login.

Our extention of the module means that a cookie is
set with the users login name so that they are not
authenticated for every page request and also allowing
other scripts to access this info.

The module can be extended so that one is able to
add any information you like (should you want to look
up the users email address or something in a DB)
to the cookie.

pages. <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Mac-Glue-Apps-AddressBookExport">https://metacpan.org/release/Mac-Glue-Apps-AddressBookExport</a>
