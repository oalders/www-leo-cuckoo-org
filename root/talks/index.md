## Talks / Papers / Conferences

[My online slides](http://www.slideshare.net/ranguard)

### Conferences

I've been to [21 Perl conferences/workshops/Toolchain summits](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2018/user/257) (starting in 2003)</a>, many of which I have spoken at. In addition to this I regularly attend the MetaCPAN core contributers hackathon and occasionally go to the [London.pm](http://london.pm.org/) meetings, though now more the [London Node User Group](https://lnug.org/) meetings.

### DBIx::Class for (advanced) beginners
	
Introduction to DBIx::Class, presented at London Perl Workshop (2008, 2009 &amp; 2010) as well as YAPC::EU 2010 and 2012 you can find out more: [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/ranguard/dbixclass-introduction-2010) [Online Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-tbMPyNlM8) (I think there is a better quality one around somewhere!)

### Evolving architecture
	
Two talks I did for <a href="http://www.yapceurope.org/">YAPC::Europe</a>,
back in 2008 [2007 slides](https://www.slideshare.net/ranguard/evolving-archetecture) and [2008 slides](https://www.slideshare.net/ranguard/evolving-architecture-further-presentation), my ethos to architecture has radically changed [2019 post](https://medium.com/@leolapworth/the-startup-stack-that-wasnt-1581df97b2eb) as technology has moved on!
