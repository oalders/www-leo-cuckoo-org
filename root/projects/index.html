<!--
	<h4>The ultimate Perl module list</h4>
	
I put this site together for Perl newbies, often people new to Perl are overwhelmed with the vast number of modules available to them on <a href="http://search.cpan.org">CPAN</a>, this is the list of modules I use most, hopefully it will help others - see: <a href="http://perl.cuckoo.org/">http://perl.cuckoo.org/</a>

	<h4>MighTyV.com</h4>
	
Leon Brocard and I entered the BBC Backstage competition and Won!
	The results of our hard work can be seen at <a href="http://www.mightyv.com/">http://www.mightyv.com/</a>.
	Make sure to check out the 'about' page to see all the features it has.
	Loen and I did a talk at the 2005 London Perl Workshop about MighTyV.com,
	you can <a href="mightyv.pdf">Download a PDF of the presentation</a>.




	<h4>Pages, results and caching</h4>
	
"Pages, results and caching" is a talk I shall give at the <a href="http://london.pm.org/lpw/">London Perl
	Workshop</a> on December 11th 2004.



	<h4>Data::Pageset Talk</h4>
	
Here is a talk I did for London.pm on Data::Pageset, it's
	a bit rought and ready but might be of use, <a
	href="/projects/Data_Pageset_Talk/">Read here..</a> or
	<a href="/projects/Data_Pageset_Talk/dp.tar">download tar here</a>.



	<h4>Muppet intro for YAPC::Europe</h4>
	
<a href="http://www.astray.com/">Leon Brocard</a> suggested one day
	that everyone started humming the them tune to the Muppets and try
	to get as many people in the office to join in (subconsciously).
	<br><br>
	This got me thinking about the up coming <a
	href="http://www.yapc.org/">YAPC::Europe</a> (2002) and with the
	help (ok she did most of it) of my partner Kerrie we rewrote the words
	to the intro and I asked the designer at work to create a flash
	movie of the results. Unfortunately this never got shown at YAPC::Europe,
	due to a combination of bad timing and bad hardware.
	Anyway, the <a href="/projects/muppets/">Muppet Intro</a> is available
	for your enjoyment.



	<h4>Random Image Generator</h4>
	
A friend needed this for a site he was creating but didn't want to have to admin a config file for the links as well as the images.
	<a href="/projects/rand_image/">Check it out</a> and use it if you like. Though do remember <a href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net" target=_new>NMS Scripts</a>.



    <h4>Phil Lapworth</h4>
	
I created my dad's website <a href="http://www.murhill.com/">Psychotherapy, Counselling and Supervision near Bath</a> you might recognise the design.

    <h4>Patches</h4>
    
I've submitted a few patches to various open source projects, here is a <a href="/projects/patches/">list</a>.


    
	<h4>Text::vCard</h4>
	
Text::vCard is used to parse a vCard
	formatted file into a perl object with accessor methods.
	It can be downloaded from <a
	href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-vCard/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-vCard/</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/llap/source/browse">Subversion</a>



	<h4>Data::Pageset</h4>
	
This perl object inherits from Data::Page and adds additional functionality
	so that one can create page sets rather than having one massive list
	of pages. Latest version can be downloaded from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Pageset/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Pageset/</a>, <a
	href="http://code.google.com/p/llap/source/browse">Subversion</a>

	
	
	<h4>SVG::TT::Graph</h4>
	
This perl module makes creating presentation quality SVG graphs
	from any data source very easy, with many display options;
	key, title, sub title, x-lables, y-lables etc. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/SVG-TT-Graph/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/SVG-TT-Graph/</a>, <a
	href="http://code.google.com/p/llap/source/browse">Subversion</a>, <a href="/projects/SVG-TT-Graph/">Examples</a>


	
	<h4>Apache::AuthCookieNTLM</h4>
	
This module created by my self and Fancoise Dehinbo
	uses Apache::AuthenNTLM as a base class so that you can
	use the fact that IE will send the users Windows login
	details (if the server is trusted and the option is
	turned on) and authenticate the user against the Windows
	Network PDC. This is mostly useful for intranets
	so that users don't have to login.
	<br /><br />
	Our extention of the module means that a cookie is
	set with the users login name so that they are not
	authenticated for every page request and also allowing
	other scripts to access this info.
	<br /><br />
	The module can be extended so that one is able to
	add any information you like (should you want to look
	up the users email address or something in a DB)
	to the cookie.

	<a
	href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache-AuthCookieNTLM/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache-AuthCookieNTLM/</a>, <a
	href="http://code.google.com/p/llap/source/browse">Subversion</a>
	



	<h4>Mac::Glue::Apps::AddressBookExport</h4>
	
This module exports from Apple Address Book and generates HTML
	pages. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mac-Glue-Apps-AddressBookExport/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mac-Glue-Apps-AddressBookExport/</a>	, <a
		href="http://code.google.com/p/llap/source/browse">Subversion</a>
