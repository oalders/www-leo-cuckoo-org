### Just Amazing Cards - iOS greeting card app (defunct)

In July 2010 released my first personal iPhone app. It was my brothers idea and he did all the design work. You could record messages / intergrate your own photos / choose
backgrounds / borders / messages / fonts etc and email the generated output to someone. [Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCfh85Mxk1Q).
