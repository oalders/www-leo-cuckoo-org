	<h4>Second talk - YAPC::Europe 2008</h4>
	
Continuing from last year I look at how the systems, development practices and tools we have at our disposal have changed, what is now available and how it makes life/work easier.
	



	In no particular order I'll cover: Server configuration, Load balancing http, Testing, Performance, Image/application serving, Caching, Web Frameworks, Server maintenance, Object relational mapping and Cloud Computing.
	



	All of these are pointers to concepts and tools which you may or may not be aware of, and how they can fit together.
