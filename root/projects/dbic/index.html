	<h4>Discussion</h4>
	<p>I still (currently) think making table names plural
	is a better way to learn relationships, but am having
	further discussions around this; either way consistency
	is virtal to table naming.</p>

	<h4>Second talk - YAPC::Europe 2008</h4>
	<p>Continuing from last year I look at how the systems, development practices and tools we have at our disposal have changed, what is now available and how it makes life/work easier.
	</p><p>
	In no particular order I'll cover: Server configuration, Load balancing http, Testing, Performance, Image/application serving, Caching, Web Frameworks, Server maintenance, Object relational mapping and Cloud Computing.
	</p><p>
	All of these are pointers to concepts and tools which you may or may not be aware of, and how they can fit together.
